✅ What You Did Today

💰 Drop System Core:

Finalized DropComponent with weighted roll logic
Built DropContext with level, karma, source type, and event multiplier
Implemented IDropAmount interface to dynamically set amounts
Guaranteed at least 1 drop if any is awarded
Hooked drop spawning to DestroyedComponent using signals and CallDeferred
Added clean debug logging, then stripped it for production
🧠 Auto-Drop Parenting:

Walked up the node tree to auto-assign a DropLayer at runtime
Fallback to GetTree().CurrentScene if no DropLayer found
Identified that without proper DropLayer, drops get added to short-lived parents
🐛 Critical Debugging:

Spotted invalid parenting via @Node2D@XYZ logs
Resolved a Label ObjectDisposedException likely due to old HUD references
Health updates working, but currency HUD fails after second death

🧭 Tomorrow’s Jump Point – Drop Persistence & HUD Sync

🔥 Main Goal
Fix currency HUD sync on level retry and ensure drops persist only if level is completed.

🔧 Tasks
Fix HUDCurrency not updating on second life:
Investigate stale references or missing signal reconnects
Ensure HUDCurrency rebinds on level reload
Add defensive checks to avoid accessing freed UI nodes
Make Drops Non-Persistent Unless Level Cleared:
Track dropped currency this run (e.g., in LevelFlowComponent)
Only add it to AutoGameStats if the level is cleared
On failure, discard drops (but show them in real-time during play)

🧪 Bonus Ideas
Add a floating text for currency/health pickup
Play sound when a drop is picked up
Magnet pull mechanic for uncollected drops
