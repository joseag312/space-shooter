🧩 Godot Integration

🧭 Tomorrow’s Jump Point

🔧 Implement Karma System
Add a Karma integer field (probably to a GameState singleton or a component)
Create a HandleChoice(string choice) method:
private void HandleChoice(string choice)
{
	if (choice == "Optimist") G.SS.Karma++;
	else if (choice == "Pessimist") G.SS.Karma--;
}
Call it after each prompt response

🎯 Finish Soundtrack Looping + Control
Enable loop on the .ogg stream via Inspector (if not done yet)
Test fade-in/out transitions via AutoMusic.FadeIn() and FadeOut()
(Optional) Save looped track as .tres for reuse in other levels
Create scene trigger points (e.g., main menu = fade in music, game over = fade out)
