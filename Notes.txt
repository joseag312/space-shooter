🧭 Tomorrow’s Jump Point – Drop System Beginnings

🎯 Main Goal
Start building the Drop System, which triggers when an enemy is destroyed by a weapon.

🧱 Core Concepts
Drop Component (per enemy):
Each enemy will have a component that defines what they can drop.
Weighted Drop Table:
The drop component holds a list of possible drops, each with its own drop chance.
Example:
1% chance – drops 500 coins
15% chance – drops 50 coins
25% chance – drops 20 coins
Everything else – drops nothing
Triggering Drops:
When the enemy dies, their drop component checks the table and spawns something if the roll succeeds.

🧠 Optional Ideas for Later
Create a base class or interface for all pickups (money, ammo, etc.), so they can be handled consistently.
Use a soft-coded database (like the WeaponDatabase autoload) to manage different pickup types.

🔥 Add polish
Magnet effect that pulls pickups toward the player
Fade out animations
Sound effects or particles
Some pickups might grant ammunition or boosts instead of coins.

🎵 Bonus (Optional but Saved)
Convert your audio tracks into .tres resources.
This lets you:
Set loop, volume, and other settings once
Reuse them easily in different scenes like menus and levels
