✅ Today's Accomplishments

1. Promoted Weapon Type System to Portfolio
Moved 🧬 Weapon Type System (elemental/tech RPS behavior) from the showcase backlog into your portfolio roadmap because it’s easy to implement but adds clarity and tactical flavor.

2. Weapon System Refactor Milestone
Renamed WeaponInstanceData ➜ ✅ WeaponStateComponent
Removed EffectiveWeaponData
You now use WeaponStateComponent as the unified runtime model, with BaseData inside it.
 → This simplifies data access, improves clarity, and keeps the runtime metadata lightweight and powerful.

✅ 3. Roadmap Audit & Realignment
Reviewed portfolio roadmap, showcase backlog, and feature priority.
Cleanly separated must-haves vs. stretch goals, focusing your dev energy.

EXTRA:

✅ Weapon System Overhaul
Refined WeaponStateComponent:
Clarified how overrides work (-1 = "no override").
Confirmed which properties use BaseData vs. override values.
Finalized these flags:
public bool HasOverrideDamage => OverrideDamage >= 0;
public bool HasOverrideDamagePercentage => OverrideDamagePercentage >= 0;
public bool HasOverrideCooldown => OverrideCooldownTime >= 0f;
public bool HasOverrideMaxAmount => OverrideMaxAmount >= 0;
public bool HasOverrideUnlocked => UseOverrideUnlocked;
Confirmed how DefaultWeaponState() works:
Now properly pulls from WeaponDataComponent base values, only setting overrides to -1 or false.
Verified that the autoload Save() reflects changes to the state (e.g., cooldowns or amount changes).
✅ HUD Integration
Defined structure for HUDPowers, which includes:
BigLaserTexture
4 PowerUpContainers (with Icon + AmountLabel)
New: CooldownOverlay nodes now added!
Created UpdateWeaponsDisplay():
Pulls from AutoWeaponInventory
Shows textures and updates UI labels
Confirmed that invisible/missing power-ups will just not have an icon set (no toggling container visibility).
Hooked up debug-friendly logs to verify that states match what’s expected:
Effective values
CooldownRemaining
CurrentAmount
BaseData values (e.g., MaxAmount, DisplayName, Cooldown)
✅ Bug Tracking & Resolution
Investigated save/load issues:
Confirmed all weapon states do pull from database.
Fixed earlier confusion about why override values were showing -1.
Added rich debug lines across:
_Ready, Load, Save, Reset, AssignWeapons, and UpdateWeaponsDisplay
Helps visualize exact flow and contents of inventory state

🟨 Starting Point for Tomorrow

⚡ Tomorrow's Jump Point
You're now ready to plug the cooldown system into the HUD overlays:

🔜 Next Steps:

Create a per-frame update method that:
Tracks cooldown time per equipped weapon
Adjusts CooldownOverlay opacity or fill amount accordingly
Hides the overlay when cooldown is 0
Extend PowerSlotUI and HUDPowers to:
Cache WeaponStateComponent
Update overlay every _Process() or using a signal/timer system
Eventually:
Animate the cooldown fade or radial bar
Add sound/feedback when a power becomes ready again

MUSIC should repeat itself?

🧭 Continue From:
Save/load/debug/reset foundations are in place for all major autoloads
🔧 Suggested Next Steps:
Task	Priority	Notes
✅ Add Reset buttons to the upcoming Settings screen	🔜 High	Hook into the reset methods already created
🛠 Add runtime weapon upgrades / effects (e.g. increase damage temporarily)	Mid	Use OverrideDamage and call Save()
🎨 Show equipped weapon in HUD or allow switching	Mid	Visual feedback for current weapon state
💾 Save/load ship equipped weapons or levels reached	Low	Expand persistence logic as needed
🧪 Add debug panel with live weapon state display	Optional	Great for tuning during testing

Powers are triggered by the player and have unique effects
May be unlocked via drop, level, or menu
⚡ First Powers to Prototype
🌀 Teleport – instantly move forward or dodge
💥 Missile (AOE) – fires a big area-damage shot
🔥 Death Ray – sustained beam in one direction
🛡 Shield – temporary invincibility or hit buffer
🧱 Recommended First Steps
Build a PowerManagerComponent on the Ship
Add basic activation/input slots (Power1, Power2)
Add a simple interface IPowerBehavior
Start with Missile as it’s the easiest to prototype visually
