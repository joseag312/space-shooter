✅ Summary of Today

🎭 Level 5 Dialog & Branching Endings
Wrote complete LevelDialog and ClearLevelDialog sequences for Level 5.
Incorporated Karma-based branching:
Positive: Redemption arc with human family reunion and Spin God slowing/stopping his spin.
Neutral: Resigned detachment, hints at stopping but no clear resolution.
Negative: Full villain turn with “age of spinning gods” declaration.
Blended absurd humor (Cat GPT decoding stalls, Bob with doughnuts) with emotional beats.
Integrated subtle callbacks to Spin God’s backstory (“been spinning forever…”) for continuity and impact.

🌀 Final Touches on Spin God Arc
Locked in escalation beats: calm → triggered (“Dr. Ethel”) → grandiose mission statements → vulnerability or rage depending on choices.
Added multiple HandleChoice moments for player agency mid-dialog.
Maintained character voices for OIIA, Commander, Bob, and Cat GPT with consistent humor-tone balance.

🏁 Portfolio Version Milestone
All 5 levels completed with dialogs, encounters, and endings.
Portfolio cut now contains full gameplay loop from start to finish.
