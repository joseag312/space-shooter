Supports multiple attack styles (e.g., aimed + spread)
Utilizes the existing weapon system, plugged in like LEGO
💎 Loot Tables
📦 Fully standardized loot tiers:
Common, Rare, Epic
Likely now driving future enemy drops cleanly and flexibly

🚀 Tomorrow’s Jump Point – Continue Boss Enemy #1

🎯 Goal:
    🔀 Implement a RandomMovementComponent for the mini-boss:
    Moves in a defined pattern (e.g., float → pause → reposition)
    Possibly includes drift, burst, or unpredictable dodges

🧪 Optionals Being Tackled:
    ✅ Reset Buttons planned for the Settings screen
    🛠️ Weapon upgrades/effects are up next (optional category)
