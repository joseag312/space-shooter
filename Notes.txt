🧭 Tomorrow’s Jump Point – Powers Begin!

🎯 Main Goal
Start implementing the player power system:

Powers are triggered by the player and have unique effects
May be unlocked via drop, level, or menu
⚡ First Powers to Prototype
🌀 Teleport – instantly move forward or dodge
💥 Missile (AOE) – fires a big area-damage shot
🔥 Death Ray – sustained beam in one direction
🛡 Shield – temporary invincibility or hit buffer
🧱 Recommended First Steps
Build a PowerManagerComponent on the Ship
Add basic activation/input slots (Power1, Power2)
Add a simple interface IPowerBehavior
Start with Missile as it’s the easiest to prototype visually
