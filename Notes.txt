✅ Summary of Today – Cooldown HUD & Overlay Visuals

Today, you:

🎯 Rebuilt the HUDPowers system for weapons and power-ups:

Plugged in all TextureRect and Label nodes using [Export] for clarity and control.
Initialized consistent color states across buttons, overlays, and icons.
Implemented a modular cooldown effect with:
Flashing icons at the start and end
Overlay fades for visual feedback
Async/tween-based sequencing using StartCooldown()
🔁 Replaced PowerSlotUI class:

Simplified by directly referencing Label and TextureRects.
Switched to clear utility functions:
SetSlotDisplay() for initial setup
UpdateAmount() for per-use updates
UpdateAllAmounts() to sync all values
🧩 Connected everything with:

SetWeaponManager() to hook into WeaponFired signal
Cooldown visuals that respond in real time
Fallback visuals and visibility control to prevent ghosting
💎 Bonus polish:

🚀 Missile Weapon Firing

Implemented the missile weapon slot and connected it to the full cooldown and ammo system.
Used EffectiveSpeed correctly for missile movement.
Ensured ammo decrement and cooldown/disable visuals work depending on remaining charges.
💥 Visual Effects on Impact

Created a reusable EffectOnImpactComponent that listens to hitbox collisions.
Spawned a configured scene (pp_missile_explosion.tscn) at the appropriate parent level.
Solved parenting issues and flush-time physics issues by using CallDeferred().
🧨 Explosion Behavior

Hooked up a dedicated PpMissileMachExplosion scene.
Printed and confirmed parent types for correct hierarchy positioning.
Optionally linked destruction to the end of AnimatedSprite2D animation using a new EffectSpawnComponent.
🧊 HUD Polish & Cooldown Logic

Fully wired up the HUDPowers system.
Built a fallback animation (DisableWeapon) when a power runs out of charges.
Implemented shared color states for cooldowns, flashes, overlays.
Cleaned up and clarified WeaponStateComponent, adding MinimumCooldownTime = 0.1f.
🧹 Data Cleanup & Debugging

Resolved broken saves by clearing .godot user save files.
Restored broken references and missing keys in AutoWeaponInventory.

⏱️ Starting Point for Tomorrow

🧠 Core Focus: Enemies Fire Back

Begin implementing enemy weapons that fire projectiles.
Hook up AI logic to control when and how enemies fire.
💡 Weapon System Reuse

Use the existing weapon firing system for enemies:
Spawn from defined points (e.g. Center, LeftMuzzle)
Set different ProjectilePath, Speed, and Damage in WeaponDataComponent
Use AutoWeaponFirer or a new firing component on enemies
🔜 Next Steps

Add a WeaponFirerComponent to enemies.
Make a basic enemy shoot missiles or bullets downward at intervals.
Track enemy-fired projectiles using tags or layers.
Integrate damage and effect visuals when enemy weapons hit the player.
Play any HUD/SFX feedback
🧠 Possibly start planning enemy AI: basic shooters, aiming, intervals

MUSIC should repeat itself?

🧭 Continue From:
Save/load/debug/reset foundations are in place for all major autoloads
🔧 Suggested Next Steps:
Task	Priority	Notes
✅ Add Reset buttons to the upcoming Settings screen	🔜 High	Hook into the reset methods already created
🛠 Add runtime weapon upgrades / effects (e.g. increase damage temporarily)	Mid	Use OverrideDamage and call Save()
🎨 Show equipped weapon in HUD or allow switching	Mid	Visual feedback for current weapon state
💾 Save/load ship equipped weapons or levels reached	Low	Expand persistence logic as needed
🧪 Add debug panel with live weapon state display	Optional	Great for tuning during testing

Powers are triggered by the player and have unique effects
May be unlocked via drop, level, or menu
⚡ First Powers to Prototype
🌀 Teleport – instantly move forward or dodge
💥 Missile (AOE) – fires a big area-damage shot
🔥 Death Ray – sustained beam in one direction
🛡 Shield – temporary invincibility or hit buffer
🧱 Recommended First Steps
Build a PowerManagerComponent on the Ship
Add basic activation/input slots (Power1, Power2)
Add a simple interface IPowerBehavior
Start with Missile as it’s the easiest to prototype visually
