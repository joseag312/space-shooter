✅ Summary of Today

🚀 Weapon System Logic Upgrade

Refactored conditional powers to emit a unique success signal (EmitSuccessSignalName) per weapon.
The Teleport power now emits PPTeleportSuccess, and the system detects it dynamically via:
string successSignal = weapon.BaseData.EmitSuccessSignalName;
Used this to trigger OnPowerUsed only when successful, avoiding double CurrentAmount deductions for conditional weapons like missiles and teleport.
🧠 Signal Debugging

Verified TeleportWeaponComponent emits the right signal and no longer gets stuck by being a child of the ship.
Cleaned up signal connection logic using:
weaponInstance.Connect(successSignal, Callable.From(() => OnPowerSucceeded(weaponSlot, weapon)));
✨ Visual Effects

Designed the visual logic to spawn a one-time effect (e.g., teleport flash) in a proper container instead of being a child of the ship.
Added IEffectSpawningWeapon interface:
public interface IEffectSpawningWeapon
{
    Node2D EffectContainer { get; set; }
}
The WeaponManagerComponent now checks for this interface and injects the appropriate container (like G.EffectContainer) upon instantiation.
🐛 Fixed:

A bug where teleport effect failed to load due to typo in path (proyectiles → projectiles).

⏱️ Starting Point for Tomorrow

⚡️ Core Focus: Enemies Fire Back
Begin implementing enemies that fire projectiles.
Track enemy-fired projectiles using tags or layers.
Add a WeaponFirerComponent to enemies.

🧨 Create the rest of the Powers
    🔥 Death Ray – sustained beam in one direction
    🛡 Shield – temporary invincibility or hit buffer
Use the existing weapon firing system for enemies
Spawn from defined points (e.g. Center, LeftMuzzle)
Set different ProjectilePath, Speed, and Damage in WeaponDataComponent

🧠 Possibly start planning enemy AI: basic shooters, aiming, intervals

Save/load/debug/reset foundations are in place for all major autoloads

✅ Add Reset buttons to the upcoming Settings screen
🛠 Add runtime weapon upgrades / effects
🎨 Allow switching
💾 Save/load ship equipped weapons or levels reached

Powers are triggered by the player and have unique effects
May be unlocked via drop, level, or menu
⚡ First Powers to Prototype

🧱 Recommended First Steps
Build a PowerManagerComponent on the Ship
Add basic activation/input slots (Power1, Power2)
Add a simple interface IPowerBehavior
Start with Missile as it’s the easiest to prototype visually
