✅ Summary of Today – Cooldown HUD & Overlay Visuals

Today, you:

🎯 Rebuilt the HUDPowers system for weapons and power-ups:

Plugged in all TextureRect and Label nodes using [Export] for clarity and control.
Initialized consistent color states across buttons, overlays, and icons.
Implemented a modular cooldown effect with:
Flashing icons at the start and end
Overlay fades for visual feedback
Async/tween-based sequencing using StartCooldown()
🔁 Replaced PowerSlotUI class:

Simplified by directly referencing Label and TextureRects.
Switched to clear utility functions:
SetSlotDisplay() for initial setup
UpdateAmount() for per-use updates
UpdateAllAmounts() to sync all values
🧩 Connected everything with:

SetWeaponManager() to hook into WeaponFired signal
Cooldown visuals that respond in real time
Fallback visuals and visibility control to prevent ghosting
💎 Bonus polish:

Clean base/flash/overlay color handling
Ready-to-plug opacity variable and transition infrastructure

🟨 Starting Point for Tomorrow

You're now set to plug weapon visuals into gameplay combat:

🔜 Up Next:
🔫 Enemies will now begin firing projectiles at you
🚀 Missile slot weapon will be added and plugged into the existing WeaponManagerComponent
Show missile count
Trigger cooldown and flash animation
Play any HUD/SFX feedback
🧠 Possibly start planning enemy AI: basic shooters, aiming, intervals

MUSIC should repeat itself?

🧭 Continue From:
Save/load/debug/reset foundations are in place for all major autoloads
🔧 Suggested Next Steps:
Task	Priority	Notes
✅ Add Reset buttons to the upcoming Settings screen	🔜 High	Hook into the reset methods already created
🛠 Add runtime weapon upgrades / effects (e.g. increase damage temporarily)	Mid	Use OverrideDamage and call Save()
🎨 Show equipped weapon in HUD or allow switching	Mid	Visual feedback for current weapon state
💾 Save/load ship equipped weapons or levels reached	Low	Expand persistence logic as needed
🧪 Add debug panel with live weapon state display	Optional	Great for tuning during testing

Powers are triggered by the player and have unique effects
May be unlocked via drop, level, or menu
⚡ First Powers to Prototype
🌀 Teleport – instantly move forward or dodge
💥 Missile (AOE) – fires a big area-damage shot
🔥 Death Ray – sustained beam in one direction
🛡 Shield – temporary invincibility or hit buffer
🧱 Recommended First Steps
Build a PowerManagerComponent on the Ship
Add basic activation/input slots (Power1, Power2)
Add a simple interface IPowerBehavior
Start with Missile as it’s the easiest to prototype visually
