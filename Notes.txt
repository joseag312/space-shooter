✅ Today's Accomplishments

🔧 Fixed currentCooldowns Not Tracking
Identified that _currentCooldowns was empty because _weaponCooldowns was partially using numeric keys (i + 2) instead of weapon string keys.
Realigned key usage across _weaponCooldowns and _currentCooldowns to consistently use weapon IDs (e.g. "PPBasicBlue").
🔍 Debugged GetEffectiveWeaponData("")
Traced an empty string key call to GetEffectiveWeaponData — caused by uninitialized weapon slots during new game starts.
Added proper null and string.IsNullOrEmpty() guards to prevent logic from running on unequipped weapons.
Improved debug output to clearly show when invalid or empty keys are passed.
🧠 Identified Future Fix
Realized that slotKeys[i] may contain empty or missing weapon keys at game start (first playthrough), so:
_specialWeapons[i] = inventory.GetEffectiveWeaponData(slotKeys[i]);
will set them to null, which is okay — just needs to be handled gracefully in cooldown registration and firing logic.

🟨 Starting Point for Tomorrow

✅ basicWeapon and bigWeapon load correctly.
⛔ specialWeapons will likely be null due to no equipped data during new game.
🔁 Ensure you only add cooldown entries if weapon != null && weapon.Key != "".

MUSIC should repeat itself?

🧭 Continue From:
You now have runtime state, persistence, and damage all working together
Save/load/debug/reset foundations are in place for all major autoloads
🔧 Suggested Next Steps:
Task	Priority	Notes
✅ Add Reset buttons to the upcoming Settings screen	🔜 High	Hook into the reset methods already created
🛠 Add runtime weapon upgrades / effects (e.g. increase damage temporarily)	Mid	Use OverrideDamage and call Save()
🎨 Show equipped weapon in HUD or allow switching	Mid	Visual feedback for current weapon state
💾 Save/load ship equipped weapons or levels reached	Low	Expand persistence logic as needed
🧪 Add debug panel with live weapon state display	Optional	Great for tuning during testing

Powers are triggered by the player and have unique effects
May be unlocked via drop, level, or menu
⚡ First Powers to Prototype
🌀 Teleport – instantly move forward or dodge
💥 Missile (AOE) – fires a big area-damage shot
🔥 Death Ray – sustained beam in one direction
🛡 Shield – temporary invincibility or hit buffer
🧱 Recommended First Steps
Build a PowerManagerComponent on the Ship
Add basic activation/input slots (Power1, Power2)
Add a simple interface IPowerBehavior
Start with Missile as it’s the easiest to prototype visually
