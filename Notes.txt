✅ What You Did Today

✅ What You Did Today

🔧 Fixed & Refactored
✅ Refactored enemy spawning to parent into EnemyContainer
✅ Rewired DropComponent to use DropTarget, avoiding fragile GetParent() chains
✅ Passed DropContainer to enemies at spawn time (Recurrent + Wave spawners)
✅ Rewired WeaponManagerComponent to accept ProjectileContainer as a spawn target
✅ Handled shield vs. projectile parenting using locationType == ShipAttached
✅ Centralized explosions into EffectContainer via DestroyedComponent
✅ Assigned TargetContainer to DestroyedComponent on both Ship and Enemies at runtime
✅ Flipped your level logic structure so Level1Script owns LevelFlowComponent (clean dependency direction)
✅ Restructured your level scene into a clean, scalable hierarchy

🧭 Tomorrow’s Jump Point – Drop Persistence & HUD Sync

🐛 Unresolved Bug
HUDCurrency crash after second death

❌ ObjectDisposedException: likely caused by holding a stale reference to the money label
💡 Root cause: HUD scene may not be properly re-instantiated or signals not reconnected after respawn
✅ Your new modular scene structure makes this easier to fix now
🎯 Immediate Goals
🔧 1. Rewire Floating Text Spawns

➕ Pickup text (e.g., +20) → spawn in EffectContainer
❤️ Ship damage/heal text → spawn as child of Ship (so it follows movement)
✅ Update spawn methods to accept correct target parent
🧪 2. Test Full Level Flow

Die → Respawn → Die again
Verify:
HUD elements are correctly reset
Explosions and drops go to the right containers
No crashes or null references
🛠️ Fix HUDCurrency Bug
🔍 Investigate stale reference or missing signal connections
🧼 Ensure HUDCurrency rebinds cleanly on level reload
🛡 Add defensive checks before updating freed nodes
💰 Make Drops Non-Persistent Until Level Is Cleared
📦 Track dropped currency this run (e.g., in LevelFlowComponent)
✅ Only add to AutoGameStats.Currency if level is completed
❌ On death/failure, discard drop value — but still show them visually in real-time
✨ Bonus Ideas
💬 Add floating text when pickups are collected
🔊 Play sound on drop pickup
🧲 Add magnet pull mechanic for drops near the player
