✅ Summary of Today - 🛠 Weapon Upgrade Pricing Overhaul

Added GetPriceAtLevel() to WeaponStateComponent for flexible, level-based price calculation.
Kept GetNextPrice() as a wrapper for normal use.
Enabled the store to preview progressive upgrade costs without touching actual weapon state.
🎯 Upgrade UI Refactor
Rebuilt UpgradePowerUpContainer as a multi-row upgrade panel for: Speed, Damage/Damage%, Cooldown, and Storage.
Each row hides if not upgradeable and uses progressive pricing from WeaponStateComponent.
Removed per-row price labels → now one Total Price at the bottom.
Green highlight for level number when pending an upgrade.
Confirm button applies all queued upgrades in one transaction.
💰 HUD Currency Glow-Up
Overhauled HUDCurrency to animate currency changes:
Slot-machine scramble of same-digit numbers.
Color flash (green for gain, red for spend).
Punch-scale animation for extra juice.
Safe concurrent updates via per-label animation gating.

🚀 Tomorrow’s Jump Point – Ship Upgrades & Weapon Equip

🎯 Goal:
Implement a Ship Armory / Loadout screen where the player can:

Equip weapons from their unlocked inventory into ship slots.
View weapon stats (Effective values from WeaponStateComponent).
Integrate upgrades directly into weapon equip flow so changes reflect in the loadout.
Save/load equipped weapons into WeaponInventoryManager for persistence.
📋 Key Steps:
Build Loadout UI: Slot buttons (basic, big, special 1–4) that open a weapon selection panel.
Weapon selection panel lists unlocked weapons with their current stats.
Selecting a weapon assigns it to that slot in WeaponInventoryManager.
Tie in to WeaponManagerComponent so equipped weapons are used in gameplay.
Add a quick compare overlay so the player can see stat changes before confirming.
