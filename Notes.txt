âœ… Todayâ€™s Progress â€“ Drop System Core Success

We accomplished the foundation of your drop system with clean, extensible architecture:

ðŸ§± Systems Implemented
Base Drop Scene (DropBase)
Handles pickup logic
Auto-despawn with animated exit (scale + fade)
Calls HandlePickup() for custom behavior
Currency Drop (DropMewnits)
Adds to G.GS.Mewnits when picked up
Uses hitbox/hurtbox system to detect player pickup
PulseComponent
Animates a pulsing + flashing effect while idle
Can be cleanly disabled before pickup animation
Visual polish
Drop scales up and fades out smoothly when collected
Debug tools added to confirm layers, signals, and hits
Collision setup
Drop has a HurtboxComponent on a specific layer
Ship has a HitboxComponent, and the system is wired

ðŸ§­ Tomorrowâ€™s Jump Point â€“ Drop System Expansion

We'll wire drops into enemy death logic.

ðŸŽ¯ Main Goal
When an enemy dies, it evaluates a weighted drop table and spawns a drop (or not) based on a random roll.

ðŸ§± Key Pieces to Build
DropTableComponent (per enemy)
Holds a list of drop entries: each with a chance and a scene
Can be reused for currency, health, or future types
On death, enemy asks its DropTableComponent:
SpawnDropIfAny(Vector2 position)
Picks one based on weighted chance
Reuses your existing SpawnerComponent or a similar instantiation method
ðŸ’¡ Long-Term Goals (Saved)

Base PickupBase interface or class for ammo/boosts/money/etc.
Global DropDatabase autoload (like WeaponDatabase)
Magnet system to pull pickups toward the player
Sound and VFX polish
.tres reusable audio tracks (for looping music, menu tracks, etc.)

RoadMap:
I want to do the cash system
I want to create the drops system, upon an enemy being destroyed by a weapon
I want to add a couple powers
	Teleport
	Missile for AOE
	Death Ray
	Shield
I want to add a couple enemies
I want to add a couple levels

Down the line (After Interviews)
Finish game (enemies, powerups, story)
I want to adapt the touch GUI
