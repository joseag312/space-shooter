âœ… What We Did Today

ðŸ”« Weapon Runtime Architecture Finalized
Fully transitioned from using [Export] WeaponDataComponent to a clean runtime system:
WeaponCatalog (G.WD) for static base data
WeaponInventoryManager (G.WIM) using WeaponInstanceData for per-run state
ðŸ”„ WeaponDataLoaderComponent Refactor
No longer exports a .tres file
Uses a WeaponKey string to query runtime weapon data
Applies effective damage and % damage from runtime+catalog
ðŸ’¥ Damage System Bug Fixed
Identified cause of incorrect damage (% overriding base value incorrectly)
Refactored HurtComponent to apply whichever value is greater (flat vs. % damage)
ðŸ’¾ Save System Debugging
Verified AutoWeaponInventory.Save() and Load() using live console data
Confirmed save file contents and runtime state persistence
Added runtime keybinding to manually trigger save/load/print state
ðŸ§¹ Reset Support Added
Implemented ResetAllWeapons() for AutoWeaponInventory
Added matching Reset() methods for AutoGameStats and AutoShipStats
Set up debug printing and state clearing for all three autoloads

ðŸ§­ Tomorrowâ€™s Jump Point â€“ Powers Begin!

ðŸš€ Tomorrowâ€™s Starting Point

UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S ALL PLUGGED PLEASE

ðŸ§­ Continue From:
You now have runtime state, persistence, and damage all working together
Save/load/debug/reset foundations are in place for all major autoloads
ðŸ”§ Suggested Next Steps:
Task	Priority	Notes
âœ… Add Reset buttons to the upcoming Settings screen	ðŸ”œ High	Hook into the reset methods already created
ðŸ›  Add runtime weapon upgrades / effects (e.g. increase damage temporarily)	Mid	Use OverrideDamage and call Save()
ðŸŽ¨ Show equipped weapon in HUD or allow switching	Mid	Visual feedback for current weapon state
ðŸ’¾ Save/load ship equipped weapons or levels reached	Low	Expand persistence logic as needed
ðŸ§ª Add debug panel with live weapon state display	Optional	Great for tuning during testing

Powers are triggered by the player and have unique effects
May be unlocked via drop, level, or menu
âš¡ First Powers to Prototype
ðŸŒ€ Teleport â€“ instantly move forward or dodge
ðŸ’¥ Missile (AOE) â€“ fires a big area-damage shot
ðŸ”¥ Death Ray â€“ sustained beam in one direction
ðŸ›¡ Shield â€“ temporary invincibility or hit buffer
ðŸ§± Recommended First Steps
Build a PowerManagerComponent on the Ship
Add basic activation/input slots (Power1, Power2)
Add a simple interface IPowerBehavior
Start with Missile as itâ€™s the easiest to prototype visually
