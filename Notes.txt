✅ Summary of Today

🧠 Boss Enemy Behavior & Systems
🎯 RandomMovementComponent completed and polished:
    Patrols within a defined TopLeft → BottomRight area
    Uses randomized velocity + manual movement
    Enforces a MinDistance to avoid micro-jitters
    Modular and starts after PersistenceComponent signals readiness
🔄 PersistenceComponent integration:
    RandomMovementComponent exports a reference to it and auto-connects via signal
    Movement only begins after boss finishes scripted entrance
💎 Drop System Enhancements
🩸 DropOnHitComponent implemented:
    Tied to HurtboxComponent.Hurt signal
    Rolls against WeightedDropTable on each hit
    Supports DropBase, IDropAmount, EffectTarget, and DropTarget
    Fully debugged with a clean production-ready version now in use
🕵️ Resolved confusing drop behavior:
    Traced a duplicated .tres file holding unexpected entries
    Confirmed .tres reference leak — recreated a clean drop table from scratch
🔧 Spawner Cleanup
🛠️ Created SpawnerUtils.SetupEnemy() method:
    Replaces repeated logic in SpawnerWaveComponent and SpawnerRecurrentComponent
    Automatically wires drops, projectiles, effects, weapons
    Future-proofed for modular enemy scenes

🚀 Tomorrow’s Jump Point

🎯 Goals:
    💢 Implement attack pattern logic (burst waves, reactive firing, or staggered salvos)
    🛡 Add defensive behavior (shield, evasive phase, or damage reduction)
    🧠 Tie together multiple AI modes/phases based on health
    🧪 Optionals in Progress:
    🎛 Hook DropOnHitComponent into boss-specific loot tiers
    🔄 Implement cooldowns or max-drop caps per hit
    🎨 Animate RandomMovementComponent’s movement (sprite tilt or thrust effects)ve/load/reset/debug — the system is future-proof!
